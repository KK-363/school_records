# Homeschool records project

This is a project designed to help homeschooling parents keep track of the hours that their children spend
doing different subjects and what events they may participate in.  

When it is fully functional parents will be able to:
1) add a student, subject and event
2) update a student, subject or event
3) add records (how much time a student spent on a subject in the current week, or day if they prefer)
4) view what subjects a student is currently working on
5) mark a subject completed for a specfic student
6) view what events a student has participated in
7) what events a student has coming up
8) generate reports for a month that tell the total hours spent and show how much time was spent on different subjects
