# school_records

# This is a project designed to help homeschooling parents keep track of the hours that their children spend
# doing different subjects and what events they may participate in.  

# Parents will be able to:
# add a student, subject and event
# add records (how much time a student spent on a subject in the current week, or day if they prefer)
# view what subjects a student is currently working on
# mark a subject completed for a specfic student
# view what events a student has participated in
# what events a student has coming up
# generate reports for a month that tell the total hours spent and show how much time was spent on different subjects
